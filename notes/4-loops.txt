running a program over and over again is called loop
for loops and while loops are common accross almost all programing languages

a while executes a block of code while the condition is true 

a for loop uses a iterator in order to repeat the values in a collection

in the range function, the first argument is inclusive, the second argument is exclusive
for example:
range(5,10) includes 5, but excludes 10
adding a third number will make the number jump by said number

break statments in loops will exit the loop
continue statments will go forward with the loop and ignore the rest of the loop when the condition is met
