basic types in python:
myint = 5 <- numeric type
myfloat = 13.2 <- numeric type
mybool = True <- boolean
mystr = "Arvin" <- string
mylist = [0,1,"two", 8.4, True] <- list
mytuple = (0, 1 ,2) <- tuple (sequence)
mydict = {"one" : 1, "three" : 3} <- dictionary

mutable = can change
immutable = cannot change
tuples and strings are immutable
list are mutable

slices can be used to get a subsection of a list 
print(mylist[1:5]) -> prints out items 2 through 6
print(mylist[1:5:2]) -> prints out every other item from 2 to 6 


dictionaries use keys rather than indexes
print(mydict["one"]) -> prints out whatever you assigned 'one' to

differnt types of variables cannot be combined

when inside a function definition, the variables you declare are confined to the inside of the function

NEVER USE GLOBAL

del mystr -> deletes the variable mystr
