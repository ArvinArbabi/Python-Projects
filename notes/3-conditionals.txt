in all programs you use conditionals for decision making
for example:
decision tree is used to reach conclusion

in python, conditional flow uses if, elif, and else
if [condition]:
    [statment]
else:
    [statment]

in case the number of selections are too long, we use match statments
match [variable]:
    case [value]:
        [statment]
    case [value]:
        [statment]
    case _:
        [statment]
